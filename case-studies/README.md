### Case Study Implementation Guidelines
> As per the client requirement, we are developing Very Basic SaaS based Hospital Management System. At the beginning, we need to work on 3 modules only i.e. Patient, Doctor and Appointment. 
> We need to develop these apps in such a way that, it would be getting converted to Microservices in the future.

- There would be 4 groups, each group will have 4 members
- Every group has to select one case study from below
